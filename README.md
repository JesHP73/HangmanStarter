## Overview 🌟

`Jess_Hangman` is a beginner-friendly, text-based rendition of Hangman. Crafted in Python,
it underscores fundamental functionalities leveraging libraries such as `random` and `nltk`. 
Players guess words, categorized based on the difficulty they choose.

## Understanding the Code 🧠

This code serves as an introductory platform for new developers. A succinct breakdown is as follows:

- **Game Logic**: The game revolves around prompting users for letters, contrasting them with a s
   elected word, and offering corresponding feedback.
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch the hangman's progression through a sequence of predefined strings.
- **Word Selection**: Players opt for a difficulty predicated on word length.

## Features 🎩

- **Diverse Difficulty Levels**: Whether it's 'For babies' or 'For brainiacs', there's a challenge waiting for you.
- **Instantaneous Feedback**: Witness the ASCII hangman take shape with every incorrect guess.
- **User-Centric Prompts**: Intuitive commands and prompts ensure an uninterrupted gameplay experience.
- **Expansive Word Library**: With the `nltk` library at its core, expect a plethora of English words to challenge you.

## Prerequisites 📋

To get the most out of the game, ensure your system is equipped with:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Either have Python installed or run the code on Google Colab.
- `nltk` library: The backbone for our extensive list of English words.

## Gameplay 🎮

1. **Select a Difficulty Level**: Whether it's 'For babies', 'You know English', or 'For brainiacs', there's something for everyone.
2. **Start Guessing**: A concealed word will be revealed. Your task? Guess its letters.
3. **Want to Exit?**: Simply type 'exit' to conclude the game.

Here's to hours of fun and learning! 🙌🏽

## Note 📌

Aimed mainly at instruction and demonstration, I created this code to fathom and instantiate basic
Python capabilities. If you're venturing into Python or scouting for a foundational project to dissect, 
you've struck gold.

### Improvements for future me
1.Add on Multiple players 
2.Add a "Hint" after x amoutn of mistakes
3.Add on real images of hangman (not \|/)
4.Better presentation a user friendly look 👓

To immerse yourself in the game, ensure the requisite Python libraries are in place. 
Since the code came to life on Google Colab, similar platforms should run it seamlessly.
